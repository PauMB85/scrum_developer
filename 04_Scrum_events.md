# 4. Scrum Events

The Events are designed to enebale critical tranparency, inspection, regularity and adaption. We prefer to use these predefined meetings with fixed objectives and maximum durations instead of ad-hoc meetings, which most likely waste our time.

The 5 events are:
1. Sprint.
2. Sprint Planning.
3. Daily Scrum
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospectove.

## Timebox Concept

Time-box is a predefined fixed maximum duration of time. In order to maximize productivity, all of the Scrum events must be time-boxed. This si essential concept in Agile methods.

## Event 1: Sprint.

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a 'Done', suaeble and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

An Increment is developed in each Sprint. An Increment is a potentially releasble part of the final product, a sum of all Product Backlog items completed in a specific Sprint and its previous Sprints.

An Increment can be considered a minor revision of the product with new features and functionalities. An Increment may or may not be released at the end of the Sprint, but it must be potentially releasable.

Customers usually request changes when they see the Increment (Sprint Revie) and we apply changes in the Product Backlog.

The important point is that we do not change the items of the Sprint Backlog after the Sprint is started and the plans are set. the Sprint Goal should not change at all either.

The Product Owner and the Developer Team might try to clarify and re-negotiate the scope as more is learned, but will not change the Sprint Backlog. Even the composition of the Development Team should not change during a Sprint.

We want them to be really 'Done' when the sprint is over and create an Increment. An Increment is the a sum of all completed items during a Sprint and previous Sprints. It is important to agree on a definition of 'Done' at the beginning of the project. We will not call something 'Done' unless it fits the definition.

Sprint TimeBoxes. Most componies use Sprint time boxes of 2 to 4 weeks. If we use timeboxes longer than one calendar month for Sprints, it will be likely for the unapplied changes to become large enough to create problems. Our goal is to deliver the final product item by item, inside the Sprint. We do not want to split a single Product Backlog item among several Sprints.

Sprint Cacellation. Even though each Sprint is frozen and does not change, the Product Owner has the authority to cancel a Sprint. this can happen when the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. When a print is cancelled, the items that are 'Done' will be reviewed and accepted, and the rest of the items(not started or partly completed) will be put back into the Product Backlog to be done in the future.

## Event 2: Sprint Planning

The Development Team does not wait until the Product Backlog is 100% planned to start developing the project. As soon as the Product Backlog is mature enough to guide us through the near future, the Product Owner and the Development Team can start the first Sprint.

Sprint Planning is a time-boxed meeting, usually fixed to 8 hours for one month Sprint, or shorter for Sprints of less than a month. All three roles should attend this metting.

The Sprint Planning ansers the following:

* What can be delivere in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

Development Team should estimate the capacity of work it can deliver in a single Sprint. The Product Owner has already ranked and ordered the Product Backlog based on the value of the items. the Product Owner also ensures that the items (stories) are easy to understand.

The Development Team then selects an appropiate number of items from the top of the Product Backlog and puts them in the Sprint Backlog to deliver in the current Sprint. the amount of work for each item is estimated by the Development Team and the total amount of work of the selected Product Backlog items is close to the estimated capacity of the Development Teams.

Following the selection of the items, the Scrum Team should craft a Sprint Goal, which is an objective that should be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog. The Scrum Goal provides guidance to the Development Team n why it is building the Increment.

The scope of the Sprint which is amde up of the items selected from the Product Backlog, might need addition of some details through the Sprint. These details should be aligned with the Sprint Goal and likely re-negotiations should be done in presence of ghe Product Owner. The Sprint Goal is also included in the Sprint Backlog.

When the items to deliver are selected ans the Sprint Goal is agreed, it is time to plan how they will turn the items into a 'Done' product Increment and realize the Sprint Goal. This is the last part of the Sprint Backlog.

This planning is not necessarily completed in this meeting. Having a detailed plan for the first few days is enough, the Development Team can prepare detailded plans for the res of the work later on.

a detail plan is breakdown of a Product Backlog item into detailed tasks needed to be done in order to create the item. Each task might have estimates, dependencies and similar information to make tracking possible.

The Sprint Backlog will be ready at the end of this meeting and the Developing Team should be able to describe what items they will deliver through the Sprint and how they will do it.

## Event 3: Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is normally a 15' meeting for the DEvelopment Team to inspect the work since the last meeting and synchronize their work and plan for the next 24 hours.

During the Daily Scrum, each member of the Development Team should answer these three questions:

1. What has been accomplished since the las meeting?
2. What will be done before the next meeting?
3. What obstacles are in the way?

The Daily Scrum meeting should be held at the same time and place throughout the Sprint, to minimize the complexity. It is just for the Development Team. It is not a status meeting for all the stakeholders.

The Development Teamn should also monitor Sprint progress each day and therefore it is a good idea for the Sprint board to be visible during the Daily Scrum meeting. They can use a burn-down chart to track their remaining work and check to see if they are going to complete all items before the end of the Sprint.

## Event 4: Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. this is an informal meeting, not a status meeting and the presentation of the Increment is instended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

This is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendees understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches everyone involved to keep it within the timebox.

The Sprint Review includes the following elements:

* Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner.
* The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been 'Done' and what has not been 'Done'.
* The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into and how those problems were solved.
* The Development Teams demostrates the work that it has 'Done' and answer questions about the Increment. The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands.
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning.
* Review of how the marketplace or potencial use of the product might have change what is the most valuable thing to doi next
* Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality of the product.

## Event 5: Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

The Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is atr most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. The Scrum Master ensure that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose.

The Scrum Master ensures that the meeting is positive and productive. The Scrum Master teaches all to keep it within the time-box. The Scrum Master participates as a peer team member in the meeting from the accountability over the Scrum process.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
* Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process and tools.
* Identify and order the major items that went well and potencial improvements
* Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its works.

The end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the nexrt Sprint is the adaption to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaption.

## Backlog Grooming

ed event discussed before, there is also an ongoing activity in Scrum projects called Product Backlog grooming.

It is the act reviewing and revising Product Backlog items, which typically involves adding fetail, estimates and order to them. The Product Owner is responsibe for ordering the items and the Development Team is responsable for estimating those items.
