# 5. Scrum Artifacts

Scrum artifacts are the result/products of our management activities, are designed to increase transparency of information related to the delivery of the project and provide opportunities for inspection and adaption. There are six artifacts:

1. Product Backlog. An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the final product.
2. Sprint Backlog. Selected items from the Product Backlog to be delivered thropugh a Sprint, along with the Sprint Goal and plans for delivering the items and realizing the Sprint Goal.
3. Increment. The set of all the Product Backlog items completed up to the end of certain Sprint.
4. Definition of Done. The shared understanding of what it means for a piece of work to be considered complete.
5. Monitoring progress toward goal. The performance measurament and forecast for the whoole project.
6. Monitoring Sprint progress. The performance measurement anf forecasts for a single S.print


## Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the final product of the project, in other words parts of the expected final product. All items are described in simple business language (non-technical) and all of them are presentable to every stakeholder. Every requirement and every change in the project will be reflected in the Product Backlog.

The Product Backlog is dynamically changing and improving, it is never complete. We do not wait until the Product Backlog is complete to start delivering the items, the first sprint can be started as soon as the Product Backlog is showing the near future.

The Product Owner sets a number of factors to determinate the value of each item for the business, return on investment is usually one of the facgtors. All these factors will be summarized into one value and this is shown with each item.

The Product Backlog items will then be ordered based on their value, in a way that the higher an items is, the sooner it will be delivered by the Development Team. As the items located at top of the Product Backlog will be delivered sooner, they will also be more detailed and clear compared to the lower items.

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Bscklog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a 'Done' Increment.

The Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal. To ensure continuous improvement, it includes at least one high priority process imporvement identified in the previuos Retrospective meeting.

Sprint backlog consist of the following:

1. A number of item selected from the top of the Product Backlog, based on their estimated work and the estimated capacity of the Development Team.
2. The Sprint Goal, which will help describe the real meaning of the items and direct the efforts of the Development Team.
3. A detailed plan for delivery of the items and realization of the Sprint Goal during the Sprint

## Increments

The Increment is the sum of all the Products Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.

At the end of a sprint, the new Increment must be 'Done', which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of 'Done'. An increment is a body of inspectable, done work that supports empiricism at the end of the Sprint. The increment is a step toward a vision or gaol. the increment must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.

## Definition of Done

When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is describe as 'Done', everyone must understand what 'Done' means. Although this may very significantly for Scrumt Team, members must have a shared undertanding of what it means for work to be complete. This is the definition of 'Done' for the Scrum Team is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.

The same definition guides the Development Team in knowing how many Products Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning. the purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team's current definition od 'Done'.

When multiple Scrum Teams are working on a single project, it might not be possible to use the same definition of 'Done' for all teams, because they might be working on items of different natures. In such a case, each Scrum Team will define its own definition od 'Done' and delivers its items bases on that definition. However, the integration of those definitions of 'Done' should be capable of creating a potentially releasable Increment in the project level.

## Monitoring Progress

You can use a burn-down chart to visualize the progress of the whole project and this is called the project burn-down chart.

A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work is often on the vertical axis with time along the horizontal.

The Product Owner is responsible to monitor the progress of the whole project toward its goal. The Product Owner determines the amount of remaining work and compares it ot the remaining work of the previous Sprints and forecasts the completion date of the project.
