# 9. PSD Glossary

1. ALM (Applicartion Lifecycle Management). Holistic view on the management of software applications ans systems, accounting for all stages of the existence of a software product.
2. BDD (Behavior Driven Development). Agile software development practice adding to TDD the description of the desired functional behavior of the new functionality.
3. Branching. Creating a logical functionality or physical copy of code within a version control system so that this copy might be changed in isolation.
4. Clean Code. Software code that is expressed well, formatted correctly and organized for later coders to understand. Clarity is preferred over cleverness.
5. Code Coverage. A measurement indicating the amount of product code that is exercised by tests.
6. Cohesion and Coupling. Coupling refers to the interdependencies between modules, while cohesion describes how related the functions withing a single module.
7. Collective code Ownership. A software development principle popularized by Extreme Programming holding that all contributors to given codebase are jointly responsible for the code in its entirety.
8. Continuous Delivery. A software delivery practice similar to Continuous Deployment exdcept a human action is required to promote changes into a subsequent environment along the pipeline.
9. Continuous Deployment. A softweare delivery practice in which the release process is fulle automated in order to have changes promoted to the production environment with no human intervention.
10. Continuous Integration. Agile software development practice popularized by Extreme Programming in which newly checked-in code is built, integrated and tested frequently, generally multiple times a day.
11. Cyclomatic Complexity. A measure of code complexity based on the number of independent logical√± branches through a code base. Cyclomatic complexity is expressed as a simple integer.
12. DRYv (Don't Repeat Yourself). Software development principle to acvoid repetition of the same information in one system, rpeventing the same code from being produced  multiple times on a code base.
13. Engineering Standards. A shared set of development and technologies standards that a Development Team applies to create releasable Increments of software and against which a Development Team can inspect and adapt.
14. Feature Toggle. Software development practice that allows dynamically turning functionality on and off without impacting the overall accessibility of the system by its users.
15. Scout Rule. The practice of always leaving the code base in a little better state than it was found befaore modification. A means to progress towards Clean Code.
16. Specification by Example. Agile software development practice based on TDD ans ATDD that calls for using examples from past experience instead of untested or abstract statement in the description of the desired functional behavior.
17. Unit Test. Low level technical test focusing on small parts of a software system that can be executed fast and in isolation. The definition and boundaries of 'unit' generally depends on the context and is to be agreed by the Development Team.
