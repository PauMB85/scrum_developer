# 1.- Scrum & Agile

## what is Agile?

Agile is defined as a mindset defined by the Agile manifesto values, guided by the Agile manifesto principales and enabled by various practices.

Agile approches and agile methods are umbrella terms that cover a veriety of framework and methods. Any kind of approach, tchnique, framework, method or practice that fulfills the values and principales of the Agile manifesto.


## Agile values

The Agile manifesto was designed to be a set of lightweight and guiding principles rather than set rules and formal processes.

The 4 values of Agile are:

* Value 1. Individuals and interaction over processes and tools.
* Value 2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Value 3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Value 4. Responding to change over followinf a plan.


## Agile principales

the 12 principles of the Agile manifesto are the guiding force for all agile methodologies:

* __*Principle 1*__. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 
All Agile methodologies are looking for ways to bring value to the customer on regular basis by communication and adaption. __Customer satisfaction is the aim__

* __*Principle 2*__. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's advantage.
This allows for some flexibility in the design rather preplan and go through formal change control system every time is an update to the scope of work. The aim is to __Welcome Change__.

* __*Principle 3*__. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
The goal is to produce something usable early and ofter. __Frequent Delivery__ is about  producing a usable increment in a short time span that the customer finds valuable.
* __*Principle 4*__. Business poeple and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
It is about having collocated teams, even you are managing remote or virtual teams, the best practice is to __Collocate__ them for at least one iteration if posible.
* __*Principle 5*__. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
In Agile, teams are self-managed and self-organizing and they are there because the want to be there.
* __*Principle 6*__. The mos efficient and effective method of conveyin information to and within a development teams is face-to-face conversation.
__Fact to face contact__ is the best way to communicate, It ties into collocation as well as open and honest communication across the team dynamic.
* __*Principle 7*__. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Focus is on a usable increment that works and not spending a lot of time on a software that doesn't work. The aim is a __Working Software__
* __*Principle 8*__. Agile processes promote sustainable development. Sponsors, developers, and user should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
Try to achieve a 40-hour work and no overtime is possible. The aim to have a __Sustainable Pace__.
* __*Priciple 9*__. Continuous attention to technical exellence and good design enhances agility.
In Agile, the entire team looks for ways to  improve quality, the design and the overall process on regular basis. The aim is __Continues Attention__.
* __*Principle 10*__. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
You need to keeo it __Simple__, no need to add extra features if they are not necessary.
* __*Principle 11*__. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
The team decides for itself what it can and cannot do and it works together on solutions. The aim here is to have __Self-Organization__.
* __*Principle 12*__. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and ajust its behavior accordingly.
In Agile, the team should have a constant focus on looking back to move foreword. The aims is have __*Regular Reflection*__.


## Empirical Process Conrtrol

Creators of Scrum methodology adapted and used empirical process control to develop the best practices of Scrum along with the Agile Manifesto as the guiding principle.

The three key aspect of empirical process control are also the three pillar of the Scrum are:

1. __Transparency__. This encompasses not only the process itself but all communications.
2. __Inspection__. Frequent inspection and the utilization of frequent reviews of the product service or results is essential.
3. __Adaption__. None of the above will work fully without adaption, wich if the ability to embrace uncertainty and changes and manage risks accordingle.

The definition of empirical is using your own experiencies and knowledge rather that buying into a set of processes based on theory or even known logic

## Agile VS Traditional Project Management

* Waterfull/Traditional. Work uses defined process and requires detailed planning at he outset, each stage is completed in full before moving to the next stage.

* Agile. work on empirical process and employs, short, iterative build and release cycles.
